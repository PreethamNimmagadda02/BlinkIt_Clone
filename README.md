BlinkIt-Clone



I built a complete e-commerce platform inspired by Blinkit using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project simulates a real-world online shopping experience and helped me deepen my full-stack development skills.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features Implemented:
	â€¢	Product Management System
I developed a fully functional product upload and listing system, enabling dynamic management of inventory.
	â€¢	Admin Panel
I created a role-based admin dashboard to manage users, products, orders, categories, and subcategories efficiently.
	â€¢	Category & Subcategory Management
I implemented a robust categorization system, making it easy to filter and organize products.
	â€¢	Secure Authentication System
The platform uses access and refresh tokens to handle authentication securely, maintaining user sessions while protecting sensitive data.
	â€¢	OTP-Based Email Verification
I integrated a secure OTP (One-Time Password) system for email verification during registration and password recovery.
	â€¢	Password Reset Functionality
Users can reset their password via email, using a time-sensitive link that ensures a safe and user-friendly recovery process.
	â€¢	Fully Responsive UI with React
The front end is crafted with React.js, focusing on intuitive UX/UI, responsiveness, and speed, closely resembling the Blinkit shopping experience
